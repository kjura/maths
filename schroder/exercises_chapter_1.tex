\section*{1-1}

We will use field axioms in \(\mathbb{R}\)  to show that \((-1)(-1) = 1\). First let us observe that:

\begin{equation*}
    0 = (-1) \cdot 0  \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{A neutral element 1 for multiplication}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = (-1) \cdot (1 + (-1)) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Additive inverse}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = (-1) \cdot 1 + (-1) \cdot (-1) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Left distributivity of addition}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = 1 \cdot (-1) + (-1) \cdot (-1) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Commutativity of multiplication}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = (-1) + (-1) \cdot (-1) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{A neutral element 1 for multiplication}}
\end{equation*}

We end up with the following equation:
\begin{equation*}
    (-1) + (-1) \cdot (-1) = 0
\end{equation*}
Adding \(1\) on both sides and using \emph{Additive inverse} and \emph{Associativity of addition}:
\begin{equation*}
    (1 + (-1)) + (-1)(-1) = 0 + (-1)(-1) = (-1)(-1) = 1
\end{equation*}

\section*{1-2}

Let \(x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}\). We need to prove that:
\begin{equation*}
    (x + y)z = xz = yz
\end{equation*}
knowing from our field axioms that operation \((\cdot)\) is \emph{left} distributive. Let us make an observation
that by definition of field, \( (x + y) \in \mathbb{R}\). This means that \((x+y)z = z(x+y)\) because of \emph{Commutativity of multiplication}.
And then using \emph{Left distributivity of addition} we arrive to:
\begin{equation*}
    (x+y)z = z(x+y) = zx + zy
\end{equation*}

\section*{1-3}

Let \(x \in \mathbb{R}\) and \(x', \  \overline{x}\) be multiplicative inverses of \(x\). 
We will show that multiplicative inverses are unique:

\begin{equation*}
    x' = 1 \cdot x' \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{A neutral element 1 for multiplication}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = (x \overline{x}) \cdot x' \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Multiplicative inverse}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = (\overline{x} x) \cdot x' \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Commutativity of multiplication}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \overline{x} \cdot (xx') \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Associativity of multiplication}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \overline{x} \cdot 1 \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Multiplicative inverse}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \overline{x} \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{A neutral element 1 for multiplication}}
\end{equation*}

We have shown that \(\overline{x} = x'\) which means that if multiplicative inverse exists, it is unique.

\section*{1-4}

If \(0\) had a multiplicative inverse then we would have \(0 \cdot 0^{-1} = 1\). But that 
would mean that we could multiply an element of reals field \(0^{-1}\) by \(0\). According to
the field axioms we should have then had \(0^{-1} \cdot 0 = 0\) but this would contradict our
assumption that \(0 \cdot 0^{-1} = 1\).

\section*{1-5}

We know that \((xy)\) is invertible because we start with the assumption that \(x \neq 0\) and \(y \neq 0\).
Which means that \(x \cdot y \neq 0\). Hence, \(xy\) is some real number, and from axioms we know that
every real number other than zero has an inverse.  

Let us first use \emph{Existence of multiplicative inverses} to settle the ground for our proof:
\begin{equation*}
	(xy)^{-1}(xy) = 1
\end{equation*}
Now we will use the chain of properties of real numbers:
\begin{equation*}
	(xy)^{-1}(xy) = 1 \cdot 1 \ \ \ \emph{Existence of the multiplicative identity}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	(xy)^{-1}(xy) = (x^{-1}x) \cdot (yy^{-1}) \ \ \ \emph{Existence of multiplicative inverses}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	(xy)^{-1}(xy) = (x^{-1}y^{-1}) \cdot (xy) \ \ \ \emph{Associative and commutative laws for multiplication (lots of)} 
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	(xy)^{-1} = (x^{-1}y^{-1}) \ \ \ \emph{Existence of multiplicative inverses and associative law for multiplication} 
\end{equation*}
and our proof is done (see also Spivak Chapter 1 3.(iii)).

\subsection*{(a)}
We will prove the following formula:
\begin{equation*}
    (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
\end{equation*}
Let us justify each step using field axioms of \(\mathbb{R}\):
\begin{equation*}
    (a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a + b) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Definition of exponentiation}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \Big(a \cdot (a + b)\Big) + \Big(b \cdot (a + b)\Big) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Distributivity over addition}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \Big( (a \cdot a) + (a \cdot b)\Big) + \Big( (b \cdot a) + (b \cdot b)\Big) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Distributivity over addition}} 
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \Big( a^2 + (a \cdot b)\Big) + \Big( (b \cdot a) + b^{2}\Big) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Definition of exponentiation}} 
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \Big( a^2 + (a \cdot b)\Big) + \Big( (a \cdot b) + b^{2}\Big) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Commutativity of multiplication}} 
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \Bigg(\Big(a^2 + (a \cdot b)\Big) + (a \cdot b)\Bigg)  + \Big(b^{2}\Big) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Associativity of addition}} 
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \Bigg(\Big(a^2 + 2a b)\Big)\Bigg)  + \Big(b^{2}\Big) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Associativity of addition}} 
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{(b)}

We will prove the following formula:
\begin{equation*}
    (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
\end{equation*}
Let us justify each step using field axioms of \(\mathbb{R}\):
\begin{equation*}
    \Big(a + (-b)\Big)^2 = \Big(a + (-b)\Big) \Big(a + (-b)\Big) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Definition of exponentiation}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \Big(a \cdot a + a \cdot (-b)\Big) + \Big((-b) \cdot a + (-b) \cdot (-b)\Big) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Distributivity over addition}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \Bigg(a^2 + \Big(a \cdot (-b)\Big)\Bigg) + \Bigg(\Big( (-b) \cdot a \Big) + b^2 \Bigg) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Definition of exponentiation}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    =   \Bigg(a^2 + \Big(a \cdot (-b)\Big) + \Big( (-b) \cdot a \Big) \Bigg) + \Bigg(b^2 \Bigg) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Associativity of addition}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \Bigg(a^2 + 2 \Big(a \cdot (-b)\Big) \Bigg) + \Bigg(b^2 \Bigg) = a^2 -2ab + b^2
\end{equation*}
where in the last step we just present our result in a more convienient notation. With that the proof is done.


\subsection*{(c)}

We will prove the following formula:
\begin{equation*}
    (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2
\end{equation*}
\newline
\begin{equation*}
    (a + b)(a - b) = (a + b)(a +  (-b))
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \Big( a \cdot a + \big(a \cdot (-b)\big)\Big) + \Big( b \cdot a + \big(b \cdot (-b)\big)\Big) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Distributivity over addition}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \Big( a^2 + \big(a \cdot (-b)\big)\Big) + \Big( b \cdot a + (-b^2) \Big) \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Definition of exponentiation}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \Big( a^2 + \big(a \cdot (-b)\big) + b \cdot a \Big) + (-b^2)  \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Associativity of addition}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \Big( a^2 + 0 \Big) + (-b^2)  \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Existence of additive inverses}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = a^2  + (-b^2) = a^2 - b^2  \ \ \ \mbox{\emph{Neutral element for addition}}
\end{equation*}
As shown by field axioms it follows that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \)

\section*{1-10}
\subsection*{(a)}
\subsubsection*{\(x\) is positive}

Let \(x\) be positive. Then \(x \in \mathbb{R^{+}}\). We want to show that:

\begin{equation*}
    x > 0 \iff 0 < x \iff (x - 0) \in \mathbb{R^{+}}
\end{equation*}

Observe that by the field axioms of reals:

\begin{equation*}
    x - 0 = x + (-0) = x + ((-1) \cdot 0) = x + 0 = x 
\end{equation*}

From our initial assumption we know that \(x\) is positive, hence \(x - 0\) is also positive and
that concludes the proof in one direction. For the other direction, assume now that \(x > 0\). It means then that
\((x - 0) \in \mathbb{R^{+}}\). Again, from the observation above, this is just an equivalent way of saying that
\(x \in \mathbb{R^{+}}\), so \(x\) is positive.

\subsubsection*{\(x\) is negative}

Let \(x\) be negative. Then \(-x \in \mathbb{R^{+}}\). Using the same observation from the positive case above:
\begin{equation*}
    (0 - x) = 0 + (-x) = -x \in \mathbb{R^{+}}
\end{equation*}
And so, if \((0 - x) = -x\) and \(-x \in \mathbb{R^{+}}\) it follows that \(x < 0\). For the opposite direction, assume that
\(x < 0\). Then \((0 - x) \in \mathbb{R^{+}}\). From here, one can easily see that \((-x) \in \mathbb{R^{+}}\)

\subsection*{(b)}

Let \(x, y, z \in \mathbb{R^{+}}\) and let \(x \leq y\). For the first case, assume that \(x = y\). Then from the definition it is clear
to see that \(x \leq y\). Assume now that \(x < y\). Then \((y - x) \) is a positive real number.  We need to show that \(x + z \leq y + z\). In other words, we need to show that
\((y + z) - (x + z)\) is a positive real number. From the field axioms of reals we see that:
\begin{equation*}
    (y + z) - (x + z) = (y + z) + (-(x + z)) = (y + z) + (-x - z) = y + 0 - x = y - x
\end{equation*} 
But we know that this is a positive real number from \(x < y\). Thus \( \Big((y + z) - (x + z)\Big) \in \mathbb{R^{+}}\) and \(x + z \leq y + z\).

\section*{1-11}
\subsection*{(a)}

Let \(y < 0\). First, assume that \(x = 0\). Then we have the following:
\begin{equation*}
    |x||y| = x \cdot |y| = 0 \cdot |x| = 0 = |0| = |0 \cdot y| = |xy|
\end{equation*}
Nowm assume that \(x > 0\). Observe that \(xy\) is a negative number. So we have that \(|xy| = -(xy)\). We show the following:
\begin{equation*}
    |x||y| = x \cdot |y| = x \cdot (-y) = -(xy) = |xy|
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{(b)}

Let \(x \in \mathbb{R}\). Assume first that \(x \geq 0\). Then we have:
\begin{equation*}
    |x| = x \geq 0 \geq -x
\end{equation*}
Assume now that \(x < 0\). Then clearly:
\begin{equation*}
    |x| = -x  \geq -x 
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{(c)}
\paragraph*{TO DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoo}

\section*{1-12}
Let \(a, b \in \ I \cap J\) and \(a < b\). Let \(x \in \mathbb{R}\). Assume \(a < x < b\), then:
\begin{equation*}
    a < x < b \iff x \in (a, b) \iff \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x < b\} \iff \mbox{????} \iff x \in \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in I \ \ \mbox{and} \ \ x \in J\}
\end{equation*}

\section*{1-13}
Let \(a < b\) and let \(x, y \in [a, b]\). Observe that \(x, y\) obey both these relationships:
\begin{equation*}
    a \leq x \leq b \ \ \mbox{and} \ \ a \leq y \leq b
\end{equation*}

So from \(a \leq x\) and \(y \leq b\) we can conclude that \(a -x + y - b \leq 0\) and this implies \(y - x \leq b - a\).
Similiarly, from  \(x \leq b\) and \(a \leq y\) we have \(x - y \leq b - a\). Assume now without loss of generality that
\(x \geq y\). Then using the inequalities we showed before we have:
\begin{equation*}
    |x - y| = x - y \leq b - a
\end{equation*}
For the second case, assume \(x < y\):
\begin{equation*}
    |x - y| = -(x - y) = y - x \leq b - a
\end{equation*}

\section*{1-15}
Let \(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) be bounded below and let \(s, t, \in \mathbb{R}\) both be infima of \(A\). Then for all lower bounds \(l\)
of \(A\) we have that \(l \leq s\). Specifically, if \(t\) is \emph{an} infimum, then the former observation applies and \(t \leq s\) (because t - 
being \emph{an} infimum - is also a lower bound). A similiar argument can be made for \(t\), that is, \(t\) is greater than or equal to
every lower bound, hence \(s \leq t\). Applying antisymmetric property of an order relation \(\leq\) we conclude that
\(s = t\), so infima are unique. 

\section*{1-16}
First, we state the proposition for infima:
\begin{proposition}
    Let \(I \subset \mathbb{R}\) be a nonempty subset of \( \mathbb{R} \) that is bounded below and let \(i =  \inf(I)\).
    Then for every \(\epsilon > 0\) there is an \(x \in I\) so that:
    \begin{equation*}
        x - i < \epsilon
    \end{equation*}
\end{proposition}

Assume for contradiction that there is an \(\epsilon > 0\) for every \(x \in I\) so that \(x - i \geq \epsilon\). Then from the inequality
we have for every \(x \in I\), \(x \geq i + \epsilon\). Observe that from the former, we can conclude that \(i + \epsilon\) is a lower
bound. We know that \(i = \inf(I)\) so \(i \geq i + \epsilon\). But both \(i = i + \epsilon\) and \(i > i + \epsilon\) are false (because
\(\epsilon\) cannot be equal to zero nor it can also be less than zero by our assumption, we assumed that at least one such \(\epsilon\) exists.).
\newline
\paragraph*{Is the proof significantly different from that of Proposition 1.21?}
We also showed that the proposition is true by contradiction. This time we had to consider a set bounded below and try to conjecture
that no matter how small a number we fix, we are always guaranteed that there will be at least one element of our set that 
is strictly less than the infimum enlarged by our fixed tolerance. We could also see that \(i + \epsilon > i\) 
(because epsilon is greater than zero) and this contradicts the infimum definition (because every
lower bound must be less than or equal to the infimum.)
\pagebreak
\section*{1-17}

\begin{lemma}
    Let \(x, y \in \mathbb{R}\), \(\epsilon > 0\) and \(|x - y| < \epsilon\). Then \(y - \epsilon < x < y + \epsilon\)
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    For the first case asume that \((x - y) \geq 0\). From the definition of absolute value we have:
    \begin{equation*}
        |x - y| = x - y < \epsilon \implies x < \epsilon + y
    \end{equation*}
    We know that \(\epsilon > 0\). This means that \(- \epsilon < 0\). From our assumption we see that \(x - y \geq 0\).
    Using transitivity we conclude that \(x - y > \epsilon\) so \(- \epsilon + y < x\) and:
    \begin{equation*}
        y - \epsilon < x < y + \epsilon
    \end{equation*}
    For the second case, assume that \((x - y) < 0\). Again, from the definition of the absolute value we have:
    \begin{equation*}
        |x - y| = -(x - y) = y - x < \epsilon \implies y - \epsilon < x
    \end{equation*}
    By a similiar argument used in the first case, \(\epsilon > 0\) so using transitivity we have \(y - x > - \epsilon\)
    and finally \(y + \epsilon > x\) so:
    \begin{equation*}
        y - \epsilon < x < y + \epsilon
    \end{equation*}
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
    Let \(a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}\). Let \(a \geq b\) and \(b > c\). It follows then that \(a > c\).
    \begin{proof}
        If \(a = b\) we trivially have that \(a = b > c\). Assume \(b > c\) and \(a > b\). We need to prove that \(a - c \in \mathbb{R^+}\).
        From our assumptions we know that \(b - c\) and \(a - b\) are positive real numbers. Adding up both yields:
        \begin{equation*}
            (b - c) + (a - b) = -c + a = a - c
        \end{equation*}
        By axioms of the positive real numbers we are guaranteed that \(a - c \in \mathbb{R+}\) because adding two positive
        real numbers is also a positive real number. 
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}
Let \(S \subseteq R\) be bounded above. Assume first that \(s \in \mathbb{R}\) is the supremum of S. Then \(s\) is an
upper bound of \(S\) by definition of the supremum. Fix \(\epsilon > 0\). We need to show that there is an \(x \in S\)
so that \(|s - x| < \epsilon\). By Proposition 1.21 we know that for every \(\epsilon > 0\) we are guaranteed that
there is an element \(x \in S\) so that \(s - x < \epsilon\) and what follows, \(s < x + \epsilon\). Now what remains is
to show that \(x - \epsilon < x\). Observe that \(x > x - \epsilon\) is true because of \(\epsilon > 0\). By the definition
of the supremum, we have \(s \geq x \) for every \(x \in S\). Applying \textbf{Lemma 2} and \textbf{Lemma 1} we conclude that:
\begin{equation*}
    x + \epsilon > s > x - \epsilon
\end{equation*}
For the other side, assume that \(s\) is an upper bound. Assume for contradiction that \(s\) is not the supremum.
Let every upper bound \(u\) of \(S\) obey \(u < s\). Observe that \(s - y > 0\). Fix \(\epsilon = \frac{(s - u)}{2}\). Then there exists
an element \(x \in S\) so that we have \(|s-x| < \epsilon\). Using \textbf{Lemma 1} we obtain \(s < x + \epsilon = x + \frac{(s - u)}{2}\).
We make the following transformations to our inequality:
\begin{equation*}
    s < x + \frac{(s - u)}{2} \ \ \mbox{for some \(x \in S\)}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    2s - 2x < s - u \ \ \mbox{for some \(x \in S\)}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    s - 2x < -u \ \ \mbox{for some \(x \in S\)}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    s < 2x - u \ \ \mbox{for some \(x \in S\)}
\end{equation*}
We assumed that \(u < s\). From transitivity of \(<\) it follows that \(u < 2x - u\). But that would just mean:
\begin{equation*}
    u < x \ \ \mbox{for some \(x \in S\)}
\end{equation*} 
But \(u\) is an upper bound of \(S\), so we should have \(u \geq x \) for \emph{every} \(x \in S\), hence a contradiction.

\section*{1-18}
\subsection*{(a)}
Let \(A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) be bounded from above. Then from Completness Axiom we know that \(A, B\) have suprema. 
We would like to show that \(\sup(A) \leq \sup(B)\).
We have that \(\sup(B) \geq x \ \ \mbox{for every \(x\) in \(B\)}\). Every element of \(A\) is also an
element of \(B\) so \(\sup(B) \geq x \ \ \mbox{for every \(x\) in \(A\)}\). The supremum is less than
or equal to any upper bound of a set so \(\sup(B) \geq \sup(A)\) because \(\sup(B)\) is also an upper bound of A and we are done.
\subsection*{(b)}
Let \(A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}\) be bounded from below. From Proposition 1.20 every set that is nonempty and bounded below has
a greatest lower bound. We wish to show that \(\inf(A) \geq \inf(B)\). Any \(x \in A\) is greater than or equal to \(\inf(B)\) 
because any \(x\) from \(A\) is also contained in \(B\) and \(\inf(B)\) is the greatest lower bound of \(B\). This means
that \(\inf(B)\) is a lower bound of \(A\) and it must be \(\inf(B) \leq \inf(A)\) because \(\inf(A)\) is the 
greatest lower bound of \(A\).
